\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The LHC \cite{LHC} is currently the largest and the most powerful particle accelerator ever built. It is installed in
the \SI{26.7}{\km} tunnel that was originally constructed for the LEP accelerator in the 1980s. The tunnel lies at a
depth of \SIrange{45}{170}{\metre} underground between the Jura mountain and the Lake Geneva, being the main part of the
CERN accelerator complex.

The machine is designed to accelerate proton beams and provide collisions at a centre of mass energy of $\sqrt s =$
\SI{14}{\TeV}. Unlike particle-antiparticle colliders, the LHC requires two rings with opposite magnetic dipole fields
in order to maintain and collide two counter-rotating proton beams. Since the tunnel was originally designed for the
electron-positron LEP, it has an internal diameter of \SI{3.7}{\metre} which is not enough to install two separate
independent rings. Therefore, a twin-bore magnet design was adopted \cite{Blewett}, which also came as a substantial
cost-saving measure.

A schematic view of the LHC accelerator chain is shown on Figure~\ref{LHC}. In the beginning, the protons are obtained
by stripping orbiting electrons from hydrogen atoms. Then they are injected into the linear accelerator LINAC2 to reach
the energy of \SI{50}{\MeV} and enter the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB). The booster accelerates them to
\SI{1.4}{\GeV} and passes the beam to the Proton Synchrotron (PS) where the energy rises to \SI{25}{\GeV}. In the next
step, protons enter the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) where they are accelerated to \SI{450}{\GeV}. Finally, the beam
is transferred to the LHC in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions where it takes about 20 minutes to reach the
design \SI{7}{\TeV} energy (per beam).

\textit{[add the number of magnets, total energy stored, number of bunches, bunch spacing etc.?]}

The LHC has four interaction points, providing collisions to four major experiments. Two of them, CMS and ATLAS, are
multi-purpose high-luminosity experiments with a peak luminosity of $L = $ \SI{d34}{\cm^{-2} s^{-1}}. The other two
experiments operate at low luminosities and have more specific physics goals: LHCb studies b-meson decays, and Alice is
a dedicated heavy ion experiment.

The instantaneous luminosity of a collider can be calculated as
\begin{equation}
	L = \frac{n_1 n_2 f}{4 \pi \sigma_x \sigma_y},
\end{equation}
where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the numbers of particles in each of the colliding bunches, $f$ is the revolution frequency,
$\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ are the horizontal and vertical beam sizes, assuming the two beams have the same size.

The number of events generated in the collisions per second is given by
\begin{equation}
	N_{events} = L \times \sigma,
\end{equation}

where $\sigma$ is the cross section of the process under study.

\textit{[add the plots with cross sections and production rates?]}

The LHC started operating on the 10th of September 2008, with the first beams fully circulating in both rings. However,
only 9 days later a magnet quench occurred in two sectors of the tunnel, which was caused by an electrical fault due to
a bad connection between two magnets. A consequent liquid helium explosion damaged a total of 53 superconducting
magnets. Over a year was spent on repairs and tests, and the first collisions were recorded on the 23rd of November 2009
at a centre of mass energy of \SI{0.9}{\TeV}. The following few months showed the continuous ramp up of the beam
energies up to \SI{3.5}{\TeV} per beam which was achieved on the 30rd of March 2010 when the LHC physics program
started.

Throughout the rest of the 2010 major LHC experiments (CMS and ATLAS) recorded approximately \SI{40}{\invpb} of data,
which resulted in the first measurements of various physics processes at the LHC. The following year became the main
\SI{7}{\TeV} data-taking period, with about \SI{5}{\invfb} of data recorded by ATLAS and CMS. On the 5th of April 2012
the centre of mass energy was increased to 8 TeV, and July of 2012 marked the first major discovery of a new boson which
was later shown to be consistent with the Standard Model Higgs boson, according to approximately \SI{21.8}{\invfb} of
data recorded until early 2013. A long shut-down is planned for the following two years with various upgrades scheduled.
The next physics run is expected in 2015 with the beam energy increased up to 6 or \SI{7}{\TeV}.

\textit{[add any upgrade details and distant future plans, like SLHC?]}

\section{The CMS Detector}
The Compact Muon Solenoid \cite{CMS} is a general-purpose detector designed to carry out precise measurements of the
Standard Model and the searches for physics beyond it. The primary design requirement was the ability to
discover the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking, and the first observation of a Higgs boson was obtained in the
Summer of 2012 \cite{CMS_Higgs}.

The detector is installed at one of the LHC interaction points (Point 5) at about \SI{100}{\metre} undeground near the
French village of Cessy, between the Jura mountains and Lake Geneva. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a
length of \SI{21.6}{\metre}, a diameter of \SI{14.6}{\metre} and a total weight of \SI{12500}{\tonne}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \leavevmode
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{CMS}
    \caption{Sectional view of the CMS detector.}
    \label{CMS}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The sectional view of CMS is shown on Figure~\ref{CMS}. In the centre of the detector, tracking and calorimetry systems
are surrounded by the superconducting solenoid. On the outermost part of it the magnetic flux is returned through the
iron yoke in which the muon system is also integrated. All the sub-systems are discussed in the following sections with
more detail.

The cylindrical shape of the CMS detector dictates using the cylindrical coordinate system, with the origin centered at
the interaction point, the $x$-axis pointing towards the centre of the LHC ring, the $y$-axis pointing upwards and the
$z$-axis pointing along the beamline in the anti-clockwise direction. The azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured from the
$x$-axis in the transverse ($x-y$) plane and the polar angle $\theta$ is measured from the $z$-axis. Tha radial distance
to the beamline is denoted as $r$. Pseudorapidity is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \eta = - \ln{\tan{\frac{\theta}{2}}}.
\end{equation}
This implies that the particles moving in the transverse plane (perpendicular to the beamline) have a pseudorapidity of
0, whereas the beam direction has an infinite pseudorapidity. Considering the cylindrical shape of the detector, it has
the barrel and the endcaps regions, with the transition occuring at $\eta = 1.4$. The momentum and energy transverse to
the beamline are denoted by $p_T$ and $E_T$ respectively; the imbalance of the energy measured in the transverse plane,
called missing transverse energy, is denoted by \ETm.

\subsection{Inner Tracking System}
The tracking system lies in the heart of the CMS detector and is the closest to the interaction point where the particle
flux has the highest value. This determines high requirements on the configuration of the system. At design luminosity
of $L = $ \SI{d34}{\cm^{-2} s^{-1}} with the bunch spacing of \SI{25}{\ns}, an average of \num{1000} particles from about
\num{25} proton-proton interactions (pile-up vertices) is expected to traverse the tracker for each bunch crossing.
However, up until the long shutdown the bunch spacing of \SI{50}{\ns} was used, which meant the higher number of protons
in each bunch leading to approximately twice as higher number of pile-up vertices. Therefore, in order for the particle
tracks to be identified reliably and separately for each bunch crossing, the tracker requires a very fine granularity
and fast response parameters. Another complication caused by the intense particle flux is the severe radiation damage,
so the tracker has to be highly resilient in operating in the harsh environment for a reasonable lifetime.

To meet these requirements on granularity, response time and radiation resilience, the tracker design was chosen to be
based on silicon detector technology. Although capable to meet such conditions, this technology has a disadvantage of a
high power density of on-detector electronics. This implies the necessity of an efficient cooling system. Moreover, a
large amount of dense material interacting with the particles leads to the higher multiple scattering, bremsstrahlung,
photon conversions and nuclear interactions. Therefore, there are complications in the reconstruction of the tracks,
meaning some loss of efficiency and precision. This will be discussed in detail later on in the object reconstruction
section.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \leavevmode
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{tracker}
    \caption{Cross-section of the CMS tracker system \cite{CMS}.}
    \label{Tracker}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{Tracker} shows the overall layout of the tracking system. It consists of the inner pixel detector, located
in the vicinity of the interaction point, and silicon strip tracker detectors: inner barrel and disks (TIB and TID),
outer barrel (TOB) and endcaps (TEC). The geometrical acceptance of the tracker system goes up to \abs\eta \num{<2.5}.
The outer radius of the CMS tracker reaches approximately \SI{110}{\cm}, and its total length is about \SI{540}{\cm}.

The pixel detector consists of three layers of pixel sensors at radii of \SIlist{4.4;7.3;10.2}{\cm} from the beamline in
the barrel region. In addition there are two endcap disks on each side at \abs z $=$ \SIlist{34.5;46.5}{\cm}. The pixel
size equals \num{100x150} \si{\micron\squared} in $r \phi \times z$ coordinates. The pixel detector has 66 million
pixels and the total area of about \SI{1}{\m\squared}.

The silicon strip tracker consists of the several layers of the silicon microstrip detectors. It covers the region
between \SIrange{20}{110}{\cm} in radius and extends up to \SI{+-280}{\cm} in the z direction. The Tracker Inner Barrel
(TIB) is made out of 4 layers and the Tracker Outer Barrel (TOB) has 6 layers in it. The tracker endcaps (TEC) comprise
9 disks, and there are also the tracker inner disks (TID) that consist of 3 discs filling the gap between TIB and TEC.
There are \num{9.3} million silicon strips covering the area of about \SI{200}{\m\squared}. The silicon sensors'
thickness varies between \num{320} and \SI{500}{\micron} and the strip pitch varies from \SI{80}{\micron} in the TIB to
\SI{180}{\micron} in TOB and TEC.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \leavevmode
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{tracker_material_budget}
    \caption{Material budget as a function of pseudorapidity $\eta$ for the different sub-detectors of the tracker
    (left) and broken down into the functional contributions (right), in units of radiation length \cite{CMS}.}
    \label{tracker_material_budget}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The silicon detectors of the tracker, the readout electronics and support structure form a considerable amount of
material for the particles traversing from the interaction point. Figure~\ref{tracker_material_budget} \cite{CMS} shows
the material budget of the CMS tracker in units of the radiation lengths\footnote{A material's radiation length is the
mean distance over which a high-energy electron loses all but $1/e$ of its energy by bremsstrahlung; this is equal to
\num{7/9} of the mean free path for pair production by a high-energy photon.} ($X_0$). It grows from about \num{0.4}
$X_0$ to \num{1.8} $X_0$ in the barrel region, and then decreases to about \num{1} $X_0$ in the endcaps. This causes a
substantial conversion rate for photons and electrons in the tracker material; it also will be discussed in more detail
in the electron reconstruction section.

\textit{[perhaps need to add the $p_T$ resolution plots]}

\subsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
The next detector subsystem which is surrounding the tracker is the electromagnetic calorimeter, or ECAL. It is of a
primary importance for the analyses described in this thesis, as it provides information for the electron and positron
reconstruction. Combination of this information with the one from the tracking system must ensure a precise measurement
of electron position and momentum, and also a sufficient background removal. It has to effectively distinguish the
energy deposit shape of an electromagnetic particle from the one of a hadronic particle, which requires good
segmentation and high resolution.

ECAL is a hermetic, high-granularity, high-resolution scintillating crystal calorimeter consisting of \num{61200} lead
tungstate ($\textrm{PbWO}_4$) crystals located in the central barrel region (\abs\eta $<1.479$), and \num{7324} crystals
in each of the two endcaps ($1.479 <$ \abs\eta $< 3.0$). All crystals are followed by photodetectors reading and
amplifying their scintillation: avalanche photodiodes (APD) are used in the barrel, and vacuum phototriodes (VPTs) are
used in the endcaps. These different choices were caused by the configuration of the magnetic field and the expected
level of radiation.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \leavevmode
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{ECAL}
    \caption{Layout of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter \cite{CMS}.}
    \label{ECAL}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The layout of the ECAL sub-detector is shown on Figure~\ref{ECAL}. An additional preshower detector is used in the
endcap region to lower the required detector depth. Its principal aim is to identify neutral pions in the endcaps, but
it also helps to distinguish neutral pions and electrons from minimum ionizing particles and improves the position
determination of electrons and photons with high granularity.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{ECAL crystals characteristics}
\label{ECAL_crystals}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
  \hline             
   & Barrel & Endcaps \\
  \hline
  number of crystals & \num{61200} & \num{14648} \\
  crystal cross-section in ($\eta$, $\phi$) & \num{0.0174 x 0.0174} & varies \\
  crystal cross-section at the front & \num{22x22} \si{\mm\squared} & \num{28.62x28.62} \si{\mm\squared} \\
  crystal cross-section at the rear & \num{26x26} \si{\mm\squared} & \num{30x30} \si{\mm\squared} \\
  crystal length & \SI{230}{\mm} (\num{25.8}$X_0$) & \SI{220}{\mm} (\num{24.7}$X_0$) \\
  \hline  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The main geometrical characteristics of the ECAL crystals are shown in Table~\ref{ECAL_crystals}. The choice of lead
tungstate was driven by the constraints of the CMS design. It is a very dense material (\SI{8.28}{g\per\cm\cubed}) with
a short radiation length of $X_0 = \SI{0.89}{\cm}$, which allows to include the calorimeter inside the compact magnet.
Lead tungstate also has a small Moli\`ere radius\footnote{The Moli\`ere radius $R_\mu$ is a characteristic constant of a
material giving the scale of the transverse dimension of the fully contained electromagnetic showers initiated by an
incident high energy electron or photon. It is defined as the radius of a cylinder containing an average of
\SI{90}{\percent} of the shower's energy deposition.} of \SI{2.2}{\cm}, which allows a calorimeter with fine
granularity. Finally, the crystals emit \SI{80}{\percent} of their scintillation light in just \SI{25}{\ns}, however the
light yield is relatively low. At \SI{18}{\degreeCelsius}, about \num{4.5} photoelectrons per MeV are collected, which
requires a cooling system capable of keeping the crystal temperature stable within \SI{+-0.05}{\degreeCelsius} to
preserve energy resolution \cite{CMS_TDR1}.

  \begin{center}
    \leavevmode
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{ECAL_resolution}

    stochastic, noise, and constant contributions are shown \cite{CMS}.}
    \label{ECAL_resolution}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The energy-dependent resolution of the calorimeter can be parameterised as follows \cite{CMS}:
\begin{equation}
  \left(\frac{\sigma}{E}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{S}{\sqrt E}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{N}{E}\right)^2 + C^2.
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the stochastic term, $N$ is the noise term, and $C$ is the constant term. Figure~\ref{ECAL_resolution}
shows the energy resolution measured using incident electrons, during the beam tests in 2004.

\subsection{Hadron Calorimeter}
The hadron calorimeter (HCAL) is the next sub-detector located inside the solenoid and completing the CMS calorimetry
system. It is essential for the measurement of hadron jets and missing transverse energy. As shown on Figure~\ref{HCAL},
HCAL surrounds ECAL from its outer limit of \SI{1.77}{m}.
