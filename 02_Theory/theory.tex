\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
\label{s:SM}
The Standard Model (SM) is a quantum field theory which is currently the most accurate description of matter and all
known fundamental interactions, with the exception of gravity. It was developed in the 20th century as a combination of
two complementary field theories, the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) \autocite{Glashow, Weinberg, Salam} theory of
electroweak interaction, and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) theory of strong interaction.

The fundamental particles in the Standard Model are the three generations of fermions, shown in
Table~\ref{tab:SM_fermions}, interacting via gauge bosons of three fundamental interactions, presented in
Table~\ref{tab:SM_forces}. Fermions, subdivided into quarks and leptons, are the building blocks of matter in the
observable universe. Their interaction via exchanging the gauge bosons allows formation of hadrons and atoms. The
difference between quarks and leptons mainly lies in the way they interact: quarks can interact via strong,
electromagnetic and weak forces, whereas leptons are only subject to electromagnetic and weak interactions. Each of
these particles also has a corresponding antiparticle with the same mass, but opposite charge.

There are six flavours of leptons in the SM, making up three generations: electron ($e$), muon ($\mu$) and tau ($\tau$)
leptons with their corresponding neutrinos. Electrons, muons and taus are massive and charged particles, interacting via
electromagnetic and weak forces, described in Section~\ref{ss:electroweak_theory}. Neutrinos, on the other hand, do not
carry an electric charge, and therefore are only subject to the weak force, which makes them extremely difficult to
detect as they barely interact with matter. In the classic version of Standard Model neutrinos are considered to be
massless, however, the observation of neutrino oscillations between different flavours \autocite{neutrino_oscillations}
implies that neutrinos are in fact massive. This is one of the deficiencies of the Standard Model, giving rise to
possible extensions elaborated in Section~\ref{s:BSM}.

The quarks also exist in three generations, and are represented by up and down (\cPqu, \cPqd), charm and strange (\cPqc,
\cPqs), and bottom and top (\cPqb, \cPqt) flavours. Together with the mediators of the strong interaction (gluons),
these particles possess another physical property called colour charge. Due to a phenomenon of colour confinement, they
can only exist as constituents of composite particles -- hadrons. More detail on the QCD theory of strong interaction is
presented in Section~\ref{ss:QCD_theory}. The top quark, however, is too heavy hadronise as it has an extremely short
lifetime of \SI{\sim e-25}{\s}, which is an order of magnitude shorter than the timescale of strong interactions. This
and other properties of the top quark will be discussed in Section~\ref{s:top_quak_physics}.

The last essential constituent of the Standard Model is the recently discovered Higgs boson
\autocite{ATLAS_higgs_observation, CMS_higgs_observation}. The Higgs field is responsible for electroweak symmetry
breaking of $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ group and therefore acquisition of mass by vector bosons. This mechanism is
described in more detail in Section~\ref{ss:electroweak_symmetry_breaking}.

\subsection{Gauge Principle}
\label{ss:gauge_principle}
As it was mentioned, the Standard Model is a unification of two gauge theories describing electroweak and strong
interactions. The GWS model, a unified theory of electromagnetic and weak interactions, is based on a gauge group of
$SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, whereas the QCD theory has a gauge symmetry of $SU(3)_C$. Therefore, the Standard Model is also
a gauge theory with the symmetry group of $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$. A gauge theory is a theory that is
invariant under a set of local transformations, i.e.\ transformations with space-time dependent parameters. To explain
this concept, let us consider a Lagrangian density of a free Dirac field $\psi$, describing free-moving fermions:
\begin{equation}
\calL = \bar{\psi}(i \gamma^\mu	\partial_\mu - m) \psi
\label{eq:dirac_field_L}
\end{equation}

Clearly, it is invariant under the following phase transformation:
\begin{equation}
\psi \rightarrow \psi' = e^{i \theta} \psi, ~\bar{\psi} \rightarrow \bar{\psi} = e^{-i \theta} \bar{\psi},
\end{equation}
since in the combination $\bar{\psi}\psi$ the exponential factors cancel out ($e^{i \theta} e^{-i \theta} = 1$). This
transformation is called a \textit{global} phase transformation, since the phase $i \theta$ is space-time independent.
The \textit{local} phase transformation, on the other hand, corresponds to the phase $i \theta(x_\mu)$ which is
different at each space-time point:
\begin{equation}
\psi \rightarrow \psi' = e^{i \theta(x)} \psi, ~\bar{\psi} \rightarrow \bar{\psi} = e^{-i \theta(x)} \bar{\psi}.
\end{equation}
Here the space-time indices are dropped on $x_\mu \equiv x$ for clarity. One can see that the Lagrangian is no longer
invariant under such transformation, since
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu (e^{i \theta(x)} \psi) = i (\partial_\mu \theta(x))  e^{i \theta(x)} \psi + e^{i \theta(x)} \partial_\mu \psi,
\end{equation}
and therefore
\begin{equation}
\calL \rightarrow \calL - [\partial_\mu \theta(x)] \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \psi.
\end{equation}

The space-time dependent local transformations are called gauge transformations. In order to restore gauge invariance
under such transformations, we need to substitute the ordinary derivative $\partial_\mu$ with the \textit{covariant}
derivative $D_\mu$:
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu \rightarrow D_\mu = \partial_\mu + i q A_\mu,
\end{equation}
where $A_\mu$ is a new vector field which transforms under a local gauge transformation as:
\begin{equation}
A_\mu \rightarrow A'_\mu = A_\mu - \frac{1}{q} \partial_\mu \theta(x).
\end{equation}

Together with the kinetic energy term of the field-strength tensor defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:F_mu_nu}
F_{\mu\nu} \equiv [\partial_\mu A_\nu] - [\partial_\nu A_\mu],
\end{equation}
we obtain the full gauge invariant QED Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
\calL_\textrm{QED} = \bar{\psi}(i \gamma^\mu (\partial^\mu + i q A_\mu) - m) \psi - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}.
%\bar{\psi}(i \gamma^\mu \partial^\mu -m) \psi - q \bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu A_\mu \psi - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}

The requirement of local gauge invariance necessitates the gauge field $A_\mu$ to be massless, since the term
proportional to $A_\mu A^\mu$ is not invariant under local gauge transformations and therefore has to be excluded from
the Lagrangian. In case of QED, the gauge field $A_\mu$ represents the photon field, and the Lagrangian describes the
interaction of Dirac fields (electrons and positrons) with Maxwell fields (photons).

The idea of requiring a local gauge invariance by introducing additional fields in the Lagrangian to make it covariant
with respect to an extended group of local transformations is an important procedure in particle physics, referred to as
gauge principle. In the example above, the local phase transformation can be thought of as multiplication of the Dirac
field $\psi$ by a $1 \times 1$ unitary matrix ($\psi \rightarrow U \psi$, where $U^{\dag}U = 1$). Here $U = e^{i
\theta(x)}$, and all such transformations form an Abelian Lie group of $U(1)$, since any two its elements commute:
\begin{equation}
[e^{i \theta(x)},~e^{i\theta(x')}] = 0.
\end{equation}

The same strategy of requiring the global invariance to hold locally can be generalised to any $SU(N)$ group: in the
1950s Yang and Mills produced a theory of $SU(2)$ gauge fields, and later on the idea was extended to $SU(3)$ group
giving rise to Quantum Chromodynamics. In fact, all of the fundamental interactions in the Standard Model are introduced
using the same gauge principle.

\newpage
\subsection{Electroweak theory}
\label{ss:electroweak_theory}
In 1961, a partially unified theory combining the electromagnetic and weak interactions was proposed by Sheldon Glashow
\autocite{Glashow}. A few years later the model was independently revised by Weinberg \autocite{Weinberg} and Salam
\autocite{Salam} to introduce massive vector bosons, acquiring mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking. The resulting
electroweak theory, usually referred to as GWS model, is based on a non-Abelian (i.e.\ not commuting) symmetry group of
$SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$. Here $U(1)_Y$ is no longer a QED gauge group mentioned previously, but the group associated
with the weak hypercharge $Y$, which relates to the electric charge $Q$ and the third component of weak isospin $I_3$
as
\begin{equation}
Q = I_3 + \frac{Y}{2} 
\end{equation} 

This equation is known as Gell-Mann-Nishijima relation, and the coefficient in front of the weak hypercharge is purely
conventional. The weak force is the only interaction that violates parity, meaning that it can distinguish between
left-handed and right-handed systems -- this fact was famously confirmed by Madame Wu's experiment in 1957
\autocite{Madame_Wu}. To accommodate for this observation, fermion fields are divided into left-handed and right-handed
components as follows:
\begin{equation}
\twovector{\nu_{l,L}}{l_L}, l_R
\label{eq:lepton_EWK_fields}
\end{equation} 
for leptons ($l = e, \mu, \tau$), and
\begin{equation}
\twovector{u_L}{d_L}, u_R, d_R; ~~ \twovector{c_L}{s_L}, c_R, s_R; ~~ \twovector{t_L}{b_L}, t_R, b_R
\label{eq:quark_EWK_fields}
\end{equation} 
for all three generations of quarks. The left-handed particles are doublets with the weak isospin of $I = \frac{1}{2}$,
whereas the right-handed particles are singlets with $I = 0$. These components are obtained by applying the projection
operators $\frac{1}{2}(1\pm\gamma^5)$ to fermionic fields:
\begin{equation}
\psi = \frac{1}{2}(1-\gamma^5) \psi + \frac{1}{2}(1 + \gamma^5)\psi = \psi_L +  \psi_R,
\end{equation} 
where
\begin{equation}
\gamma^5 = i \gamma^0  \gamma^1  \gamma^2  \gamma^3 = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

By requiring a local gauge invariance to the group $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, a covariant derivative is written as:
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu \rightarrow D_\mu = \partial_\mu + i g \mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{W}_\mu + i \frac{g'}{2} Y B_\mu.
\end{equation}

Here $g$ and $g'$ are the coupling constants for groups $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_Y$, respectively; $\mathbf{T} =
\hat{\sigma}/2$ are the Pauli matrices which are the generators for $SU(2)$ group; $\mathbf{W}_\mu$ is the triplet of
new gauge fields $W^{1,2,3}_\mu$ introduced for $SU(2)_L$ invariance; $B_\mu$ is the new gauge field for $U(1)_Y$
invariance. For right-handed particles (singlets), $\mathbf{T} = 0$ and the second term in the covariant derivative
vanishes. The resulting gauge-invariant Lagrangian for electroweak theory with kinetic energy terms takes form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EWK_L}
\calL_\textrm{EWK} = \bar{\psi}_L \gamma^\mu ( i\partial_\mu  - g \mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{W}_\mu - \frac{g'}{2} Y
B_\mu) \psi_L + \bar{\psi}_R \gamma^\mu (i \partial_\mu - \frac{g'}{2} Y B_\mu) \psi_R - \frac{1}{4}\mathbf{W}_{\mu\nu}
\mathbf{W}^{\mu\nu} -\frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
\psi_L = \twovector{\psi^1_L}{\psi^2_L},
\end{equation*}
and $\psi_L$ and $\psi_R$ are summed over all possibilities shown in Equations~\ref{eq:lepton_EWK_fields} and
\ref{eq:quark_EWK_fields}.

The newly introduced gauge fields $W^{1,2,3}_\mu$ and $B_\mu$ do not directly correspond to the physical fields of
gauge bosons, but form them via the following linear combinations:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
W^{\pm}_\mu & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (W^1_\mu \pm  i W^2_\mu), \\
Z_\mu & = - B_\mu \sin{\theta_W} + W^3_\mu \cos{\theta_W}, \\
A_\mu & = B_\mu \cos{\theta_W} + W^3_\mu \sin{\theta_W}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

We obtained the physical fields of charged $W^{\pm}$ bosons, as well as a neutral $Z^0$ boson and a photon, which were
produced by mixing the neutral fields $W^3_\mu$ and $B_\mu$ with a rotation by the weak mixing (or
\textit{Weinberg}) angle $\theta_W$. The electric charge is then given as
\begin{equation}
e = g' \cos{\theta_W} = g \sin{\theta_W}.
\end{equation}

Up to this point, there are no mass terms in the Lagrangian as their introduction would violate the gauge invariance.
However, the existence of massive \W and \Z bosons clearly contradicts the notion of massless gauge fields in
electroweak theory. This problem is solved by the Higgs mechanism of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, which is a
subject of Section~\ref{ss:electroweak_symmetry_breaking}.

\newpage
\subsection{Quantum Chromodynamics}
\label{ss:QCD_theory}
Quantum Chromodynamics is the quantum field theory of strong interactions between quarks and gluons. It is a non-Abelian
gauge theory based on the symmetry group $SU(3)_C$, where $C$ denotes colour charge. After demanding the invariance
under local $SU(3)$ gauge transformations, the QCD Lagrangian is given as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:QCD_L}
\calL_\textrm{QCD} = \bar{q} (\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu -m)q + g_s (\bar{q} \gamma^\mu T_a q) G^a_\mu -  \frac{1}{4} G^a_{\mu\nu}
G_a^{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}

Here $T_a = \lambda_a / 2$ are the Gell-Mann matrices, i.e.\ eight generators of the $SU(3)$ group, satisfying the Lie
algebra:
\begin{equation}
[T_a,T_b] = i f_{abc} T_c.
\end{equation}

This gives rise to eight gauge fields -- massless gluons. The field strength $G^a_{\mu\nu}$ is tensor is analogous to
that of QED (Equation~\ref{eq:F_mu_nu}), but contains an extra term proportional to the structure constants $f^{abc}$,
responsible for self-interactions of gluons:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:G_mu_nu}
G^a_{\mu\nu} = [\partial_\mu G^a_\nu] - [\partial_\nu G^a_\mu] + g_s f^{abc} G^b_\mu G^c_\nu.
\end{equation}



\subsection{Electroweak symmetry breaking}
\label{ss:electroweak_symmetry_breaking}
The mechanism of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking, often called the Higgs mechanism, was developed in the 1960s
by Peter Higgs \autocite{Higgs} and two other groups independently: Robert Brout and Fran\c{c}ois Englert
\autocite{Englert_Brout}; Gerald Guralnik, Carl Richard Hagen and Tom Kibble \autocite{Guralnik_Hagen_Kibble}. 

This is done by introducing an $SU(2)$ doublet of complex scalar fields, called Higgs fields:
\begin{equation}
\psi = \twovector{\psi^+}{\psi^0}.
\label{Higgs_fields}
\end{equation}
