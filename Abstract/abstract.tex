\begin{abstract}
In this thesis, the top quark mass and top quark pair differential cross section measurements are presented, based on
data collected by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2011 and 2012. The mass of the top quark is measured using a sample of
top-antitop candidate events with one electron and at least four jets in the final state, obtained from approximately
\SI{5.0}{\fbinv} of data at a centre of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = \SI{7}{\TeV}$. The top quark mass is extracted from a
combined likelihood fit, and measured to be $172.87 \pm 0.27~\textrm{(stat.)} \pm 2.17~\textrm{(syst.)}~\textrm{GeV}.$
The normalised differential cross section of top quark pair production is measured with respect to a number of
event-level observables, including missing transverse energy, scalar sum of jet transverse momenta, scalar sum of total
event transverse momenta, and leptonically decaying \W boson transverse momentum and transverse mass. The analysis is
performed for semileptonic top-antitop events, with either an electron or a muon, and at least four jets in the final
state. Approximately \SI{19.7}{\fbinv} of data at a centre of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = \SI{8}{\TeV}$ are used. No
significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed. %Sad times.
