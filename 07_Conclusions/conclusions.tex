This thesis has covered the author's and collaborators' research carried out in the top quark sector of particle
physics. Two major analysis contributions, namely the top quark mass measurement in the electron plus jets channel, and
the \ttbar differential cross section measurement in the electron and muon plus jets channels, were presented in detail.
Additionaly, the service work performed by the author for the CMS collaboration -- the high-level trigger development
for top quark physics -- was also covered. The developed triggers were not only used in the presented mass analysis, but
also other CMS top quark physics analyses using the electron plus jets \ttbar events collected at a centre of mass
energy of $\sqrt{s} = \SI{7}{\TeV}$.

The top quark mass measurement was performed using the full 2011 dataset recorded by the CMS detector with a total
integrated luminosity of approximately \SI{5.0}{\fbinv}. The analysis served as a complementary cross-check of the main
CMS top quark mass measurement in the lepton plus jets channel, which remains a most precise single measurement of the
top quark mass up to date. The mass extraction technique and the kinematic fit procedure, common between two analyses,
were described in detail. The analyses results are consistent between each other, as well as with the latest combination
result from the Tevatron and the LHC experiments.

The differential cross section measurement of top quark pair production with respect to event-level distributions is
based on the 2012 data collected by CMS at a centre of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = \SI{8}{\TeV}$, corresponding to the
integrated luminosity of \SI{19.7}{\fbinv}. The analysis selected the semileptonic \ttbar events with a single isolated
highly-energetic electron or a muon, and at least four jets in the final state. The number of \ttbar events was
determined using a template fit method, and corrected for misidentification, detector resolution and acceptance effects
using the SVD unfolding technique. The results from both the electron and muon plus jets channels were combined and
compared with different predictions of Monte Carlo generators, as well as with a set of variations in theoretical
predictions due to modelling uncertainties. In general, the results were found to be consistent with the Standard Model
predictions.

The differential cross section measurement can be improved in a few different ways. Recent studies have shown that the
binning choice for all primary variables can be enhanced by exploiting a more sophisticated fit requiring sufficient
statistics and acceptable migration between bins. Also, addition of other variables in the template fit -- for example,
the M3 variable, i.e.\ the invariant mass of the three jets yielding the highest vectorial sum of their transverse
momenta -- can improve the differentiating power between the QCD and \W/\ZpJets backgrounds.

The normalised differential cross section measurement based on the \SI{7}{\TeV} data \autocite{xsection_PAS_7TeV} (not
covered in this thesis) was performed only with respect to the missing transverse energy. Currently, the work is being
done on improving the \SI{7}{\TeV} measurement by including other event-level variables and using the latest definitions
of the reconstructed objects. This would allow the measurement of the ratio of \SI{8}{\TeV} and \SI{7}{\TeV} cross
section results, potentially cancelling more systematic uncertainties and providing more sensitivity to deviations from
the Standard Model, as well as increasing the discriminating power between MC generators. The results are due to be
published later this year, upon the completion of the current analysis work.
